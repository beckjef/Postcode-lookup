# Postcode lookup streamlit application
An application to provide a user with the boundary information and the Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) decile for the LSOA the postcode is located in. 

- Indices of Multiple Deprivation data was made available by Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government as an [Esri feature layer](https://services3.arcgis.com/ivmBBrHfQfDnDf8Q/arcgis/rest/services/Indices_of_Multiple_Deprivation_(IMD)_2019). 
- Boundary data was derived from [Postcodes.io](http://postcodes.io/)
- Active Partnership boundaries are a [Sport England](https://www.sportengland.org/) custom geography.

Streamlit application is available on [streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/jenniferbufton/postcode-lookup/main/app.py).
